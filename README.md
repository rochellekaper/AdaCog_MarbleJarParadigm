**Marble Jar Paradigm**:
The marble points (2,3,4) and color (purple, orange, green) mappings are randomized so therefore there are 6 possible experiments. 
Each one is in its own folder:
- green_purple_orange 
- purple_orange_green
- orange_green_purple 
- orange_purple_green 
- purple_green_orange 
- green_orange_purple
