**Marble Jar Paradigm**:
The marble points (2,3,4) and color (purple, orange, green) mappings are randomized so therefore there are 6 possible experiments. 
Each one is in its own folder:
- _green_purple_orange _
- _purple_orange_green_
- _orange_green_purple_
- _orange_purple_green_ 
- _purple_green_orange _
- _green_orange_purple_


The other important folder is titled _Code_ which contains the Python files used to generate the stimuli and subsequently create the condition files needed for the PsychoPy experiments.
